Description:
You and your best friend Stripes have just landed your first high school jobs! You'll be delivering newspapers to your neighbourhood on weekends. For your services you'll be charging a set price depending on the quantity of the newspaper bundles.
The cost of deliveries is:
$3.85 for 40 newspapers
$1.93 for 20
$0.97 for 10
$0.49 for 5
$0.10 for 1
Stripes is taking care of the footwork doing door-to-door drops and your job is to take care of the finances. What you'll be doing is providing the cheapest possible quotes for your services.
Write a function that's passed an integer representing the amount of newspapers and returns the cheapest price. The returned number must be rounded to two decimal places.
