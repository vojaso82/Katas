// Uh oh, Someone at the office has dropped all these sequences on the floor and forgotten to label them with their correct bases.

// We have to fix this before the boss gets back or we're all going to be fired!
// This is what your years of coding have been leading up to, now is your time to shine!
// Task

// You will have to create a function which takes in a sequence of numbers in random order and you will have to return the correct base of those numbers.
// The base is the number of unique digits. For example, a base 10 number can have 10 unique digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a base 2 number (Binary) can have 2 unique digits: 0 and 1.
